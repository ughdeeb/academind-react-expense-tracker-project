## General info

So I decided to work through Brad Traversy's Udemy course called [Academind's React-The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

Technologies used in the creation of this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS ES5/ES6
- React and JSX
- CLI
- Git and Github (with VS Code: I really want to get pushing to github from VScode into my muscle memory)
